# Welcome to My Learnings!

Hey! These courses contain my knowledge that I gained from web courses, or college classes. Everything they teach step by step, I reproduce and put them here, so they are not my own, except for the ones from college because I learn in class and I only reproduce at home with the teacher's base, that way, I end up creating different things from the teacher.
